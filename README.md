## Abstract
> CT is crucial for diagnosing chest diseases, with image quality affected by spatial resolution. Thick-slice CT remains prevalent in practice due to cost considerations, yet its coarse spatial resolution may hinder accurate diagnoses. Our multicenter study develops a deep learning synthetic model with Convolutional-Transformer hybrid encoder-decoder architecture for generating thin-slice CT from thick-slice CT on a single center (1576 participants) and access the synthetic CT on three cross-regional centers (1228 participants). The qualitative image quality of synthetic and real thin-slice CT is comparable (p= 0.16). Four radiologistsâ€™ accuracy in diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia using synthetic thin-slice CT surpasses thick-slice CT (p < 0.05), and matches real thin-slice CT (p > 0.99). For lung nodule detection, sensitivity with thin-slice CT outperforms thick-slice CT (p < 0.001) and comparable to real thin-slice CT (p > 0.05). These ndings indicate the potential of our model to generate high-quality synthetic thin-slice CT as a practical alternative when real thin-slice CT is preferred but unavailable.

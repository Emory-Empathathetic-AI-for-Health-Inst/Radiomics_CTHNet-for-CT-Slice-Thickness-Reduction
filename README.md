# CTHNet-for-CT-Slice-Thickness-Reduction

## Abstract
> The acquisition and management of thin-slice CT require greater time and storage capacity, which may not be available in every institution. Various studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using DL to reduce slice thickness, synthesizing thin-CT from thick-CT. However, to our knowledge, no studies have yet conducted a comprehensive multicenter evaluation of DL-based synthetic thin-CT, making it difficult to determine the value of synthetic images in clinical practice. In this multicenter study, we developed a DL model that can generate synthetic thin-CT from thick-CT and performed a comprehensive comparison to assess (a) the image quality of synthetic thin-CT relative to real thin-CT, incorporating both quantitative evaluation and qualitative multi-reader study, (b) the improvement in radiomics features reproducibility facilitated by synthetic CT, and (c) the performance of commercial AI tools when utilizing synthetic CT versus real CT.

## Code
We will release the code and pre-trained network parameters after the paper is accepted/published.
